       <h2>Diagnostics</h2>
       <p>Computers have been used in medicine for much longer than you might think. In the early
 days of computing development, it was mainly used in medicine to more efficiently conduct patient surveys.</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
     <p><small><mark>Slack's first patient history program, which he had used in early 1965, contained 450 screening 
questions. Each question had four possible responses. "Yes", "No", "Don't know", and "Don't understand". ...Each
 question was printed on a punched data processing card. After the patient had sorted Slack's cards by placing 
each card into an appropriate slot of a divided tray, the sorted cards were fed into an automatic punched card reader
  that transmitted the responses to a computer, which then generated a summary printout of the patient's responses.</mark></small></p>
     <footer class="blockquote-footer">The History of Medical Informatics in the United States, ISBN 978-1-4471-6731-0</footer>
    </blockquote>
   <p>Later in the same year, Slack and his colleagues stopped using punched cards for this and used a more 
sophisticated system with a screen and an interface, but this very early use of computation in diagnostics 
demonstrates how far back the link between the two fields goes.</p>
      <h2>MUMPS</h2>
      <p>MUMPS, or <strong>M</strong>assachusetts General Hospital <strong>U</strong>tility <strong>M</strong>ulti-
<strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>S</strong>ystem, is a programming language that was designed in 1966 for use
 in healthcare. It is designed for use with databases, and can handle high throughput. This proved very useful in 
the 60s for tracking patient records and other information efficiently, and MUMPS is still used today by many healthcare
IT companies and in the financial sector.</p>

      <h2>Robotic Surgery</h2>
      <p>By the early 2000s, some forms of robotic-assisted surgery were being used regularly to shorten the length of 
the surgery, decrease the amount of bleeding, and improve a number of other factors. These types of procedures are still
 carried out by human surgeons, but the use of robotics to detect the movement of the surgeon and carry it out on the patient
 has many advantages, such as the ability of the robotic system to filter out hand tremors, and much less time being lost due
 to surgeons not having to <abbr title="thoroughly wash the hands and forearms to perform or assist in surgery">scrub in</abbr>
 and out for shifts during long surgeries.</p>
